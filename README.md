--- TAB ---
TODO: Make tool settings have collapsable label frames

--- TREE ---
TODO: Add items in tree

--- TABLE ---
TODO: Add default options to init() method
TODO: Add text wrapping to cells when wrap is defined in headings maps
TODO: Sorting based on which headings have sortable headings
TODO: Sort items after adding

--- MISC ---

Sorting Problem Notes:
Default column that is sorted has order label.
Other columns have description labels.
When a column is sorted, it switches to its order label and other's switch to description label
Need to autosize columns that are switching labels
